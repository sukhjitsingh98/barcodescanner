This app scans barcodes for a unique identifying code which is used in conjunction with user input data to document the coming and going of company inventory. 

The data collected consists of an item name, quantity added or taken out, and condition of the item (Old or New). 

This data is sent through an external database (In this case Google Sheets) after being processed and formatted by a web application powered by Google App Script. 

The data in the database is tracked through timestamps indicating when the item was taken in or out of the system. 

Another feature of the app is the ability to see what data is stored in the database. This is done by clicking the 'View List' button on the main screen. This redirects the user to another view which displays the name of each item and its quantity (Per timestamp).
